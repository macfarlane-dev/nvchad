# Lessons on Vim

These notes shall record key learnings which are otherwise not recorded in the ReadMe or native documentation.


### Navigation

Nvim-tree is a useful navigational aid, but it is not the most efficient way.
You will be more efficient if you can get used to searching files, e.g. `<space>fg`.


### Multiline Editing

1. `<C-q>` OR `<A-left click>`, select rows 
2. `I`, begin editing one row
3. `Esc`, apply changes to all rows
